## Arch Linux @ 34C3

Arch Linux Trusted Users, Developers and members of the Security team have been at 34C3 and even
held a small meetup. There was also an #archlinux.de assembly where people from the irc channel
could meet each other. Seeing how much interest there was this year, it might be worth it to host a
self organized session or assembly with more stickers \o/

## Fosdem 2018 

Arch Linux Trusted Users and Developers will be at Fosdem 2018 in February. We don't have a booth or
developer room but you can probably find us by looking for Arch stickers or hoodies :-)

## 2017 Repository cleanup

The repository's will be cleaned of [orphan
packages](https://www.mail-archive.com/arch-dev-public@archlinux.org/msg25441.html), which will be
moved to the AUR, where they can be picked up and taken care of.

## AUR 4.6.0 Release

A new version of [aurweb](https://www.mail-archive.com/aur-general@archlinux.org/msg32245.html) has
been released on December third. It brings markdown support for comments and more Trusted User
specific changes.

## Happy 2018!

I wish everyone a happy 2018 and keep on rolling :)
