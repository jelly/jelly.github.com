This is the second edition of Arch monthly, mostly due to the lack of time to
work on Arch weekly. So let's start with the roundup of last month.

## New TU David Runge

David Runge [applied](https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/aur-general/2017-October/033590.html) to become a Trusted User and was [accepted](https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/aur-general/2017-October/033629.html)! He mentioned to have a huge interest in pro-audio, so hopefully there will be improvements made in that area!

## Farewell 32 bit

After nine months of deprecation period, 32 bit is now unsupported on Arch Linux. For people with 32 bit hardware there is the [Arch Linux 32](https://archlinux32.org/) project which intends to keep 32 bit support going.

## AUR Changes Affecting Your Privacy


The next aurweb release, which will be released on 2017-12-03, includes a public interface to obtain a list of user names of all registered users. This means that, starting on 2017-12-03, your user name will be visible to the general public. The user name is the account name you specified when registering, and it is the only information included in this list. See [this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/7awnto/aur_changes_affecting_your_privacy/) for more information.

## #archlinux-testing irc channel

An irc channel has been created for coordination between Arch Linux testers. See more about becoming an official tester [here](https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-dev-public/2016-July/028191.html).
