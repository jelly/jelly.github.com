This is the first edition of Arch monthly, mostly due to the lack of time to
work on Arch weekly. So let's start with the roundup of last month.

## Two new Trusted Users

[Alad](https://www.archlinux.org/people/trusted-users/#Alad) and
[Foxboron](https://www.archlinux.org/people/trusted-users/#Foxboron) joined the
Trusted Users team! Congrats!

## Archweb signoff helper

This has been around for a while, but Foxboron created this great
[tool](https://github.com/Foxboron/archweb-signoff-helper) to signoff packages
in [testing] simply from the cli. If you are an official tester try it out!

## Arch Classroom - Python for beginners

Pulec organizes a classroom about Python for beginners on Wednesday, October

network. See this

## Eli Schwartz is our new bugwrangler

## Arch-meson wrapper

If you package packages which uses meson as a build tool then the arch-meson is
useful since it sets defaults for Arch.

## Arch manpages website

A new website popped up which hosts [Arch manual pages](http://jlk.fjfi.cvut.cz/arch/manpages/).
