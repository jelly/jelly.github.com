This page lists a short summary of all the projects on my [Github](https://github.com/jelly).

[Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)
----------

As a trusted user I package Python-related software and general software which is usable for everyone and which I think should be avaliable in the Arch Linux repositories like for example calibre.

[WebApp-speedreading](https://github.com/jelly/webapp-speedreading)
-------------------

Speed-reading integration in Zarafa's WebApp. Uses squirt.io's inspired speed-reading mechanism integrated in the WebApp.

[Zarafa-Inspector](https://github.com/zarafagroupware/zarafa-inspector)
----------------

Zarafa Inspector is a GUI application which can be used to "look into" Zarafa. It's similiar to OutlookSpy and MFCMAPI but it's Zarafa specific. (This program isn't actively supported by Zarafa)

[Python-Zarafa](https://github.com/zarafagroupware/python-zarafa)
-------------

High-level Python bindings to Zarafa.

[Weespotify](https://github.com/jelly/Weespotify)
----------

Spotify now playing integration in WeeChat.
